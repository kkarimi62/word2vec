An optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope were used to observe the morphology of the sample, and an electron probe micro analyzer-wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EPMA-WDS) was used to perform the B element analysis, to characterize the reaction zone.": [{"Question": " What was the sample cut for?", "Answer": " The sample was cut to observe the horizontal cross section."}, {"Question": " What was used to polish the sample?", "Answer": " Diamond paste was used to polish the sample."}, {"Question": " What was used to perform the B element analysis?", "Answer": " An electron probe micro analyzer-wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EPMA-WDS) was used to perform the B element analysis."}]}]
